### ESLint

> ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

After installing the ESLint extension you should see a double check mark next to `ESLint` in the bottom right corner of VSCode. The plugin will load the configuration from `.eslintrc`. If you have troubles, click on `ESLint` to open the output console for more information.

### Prettier

> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. Prettier takes your code and reprints it from scratch by taking the line length into account.

After installing the Prettier extension you should see it in the bottorm right corner of VSCode. The plugin will load the configuration from `.prettierrc`. You need to activate it now by formatting your code. It should have a check mark now if it works.

```
Ctrl + Shift + P > "Format Document"
